Problem 1: Calculator (40 pts)
For this problem, you will create a C++ console app, where you will ask the user to
input a problem that they would like to solve. The calculator must be able to
support order of operation problems as well as regular arithmetic problems. The
way the program should run is by asking the user to enter the problem that they
would like to solve. Please note that this program must accept int and float
values. From there, you will use <string> library to search throughout the string as
character to find int value and operators. You can either use find() function or the
for loop to perform search on an operator, while you can use isDigit() and if
statement to find digit values and decimal points.

Problem 2: Birthday Date Meaning Generator (20 pts)
For this problem, you will create a C++ console app, where you will ask the user
for birthday date by month, day and year (2000-2023). From there, you will use
the switch statement to distinguish the appropriate response and then from
there, you will display the output and ask the user if they would like to enter
another birthday using the while loop.

Problem 3: BMI Calculator (20 pts)
Create a program that will ask the user to enter their name, age, gender
(male/female), height by feet, height by inches and weight in pounds. Keep in
mind that as you are entering the responses for every question, you will be saving
each response to a variable, which will be used further in the program to calculate
and display the output.

Problem 4: Multiplication Table (20pts)
Create a Multiplication Table program which will start by asking the user to enter
the starting range and the ending range of the numbers that they would like to
create a multiplication table on. From there, you will then ask the user to enter
the starting range and the ending range on the numbers that they wish to
multiply on the multiplication table. From there, you will use a conditional
statement to create a multiplication table.

Problem 5: Math Calculator (40 pts)
For this problem, you will create a C++ console app, where you will ask the user to
enter a problem to solve. After the user enters the problem that they wish to
solve, you will use a conditional statement to determine which operand they have
chosen and based on the operand, you will apply it to solve the problem. For each
operand that will be implemented in this problem, you will need to incorporate
functions in the program to make it more efficient.
